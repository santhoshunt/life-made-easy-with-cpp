# REGEX

> Regular Expression or regexes or regex or regexp as they are commonly called are used to represent a particular pattern of string or text. Regexes are often used to denote a standard textual syntax of a string.
> Each character in a regular expression is either having a character with a literal meaning or a “metacharacter” that has special meaning.
> For example, a regular expression “a[a-z]” can have values ‘aa’, ‘ab’,’ ax’ etc. Here a has a literal meaning and [a-z] denotes any lowercase character from a to z.
