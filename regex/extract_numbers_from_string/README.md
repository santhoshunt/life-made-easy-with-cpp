# Extracting number from a string using regex

> Here regular expression is used to extract numbers from a string. You can also use `stringstream` to do this, but it's a bit different. If you want to extract all the numbers from the string even if it is embedded like this `1there2 are nu43mber` to `1 2 and 43` the definitely regex is the easier way to go
