## Why?

> The first programming language I learned was python. It is obvious that python is one of the most easiest programming language to learn, but hey wait _should you learn python as your first programming language?_
> Different poeple have different opinion on it, **but one thing for sure most of the people who learn python as their first programming language may find it difficult to switch to other programming languages like C++** yeah you guessed it right! I'm one of 'em.
> So I'm creating this repository to organize some methods in C++ which can make your life easier.
>
> > For example there is no equivalent method in cpp let's say for
> >
> > - split()
> > - strip()
> >
> > to python, but there are some work arounds just to make it work like the way in python.

## NOTE!

> #### The aim of this repository is to help how to do things, not how the method works or any detailed explanations!!
